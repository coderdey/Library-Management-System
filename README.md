# Library-Management-System
The Library Management System caters to the needs of both users and
administrators, providing a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction with
the library's database. This system is designed to operate in both online and
offline modes, allowing users to independently manage their library activities or
seek assistance from administrators for certain tasks.

1. User-friendly Interface: A user-friendly interface allows customers (users)
to navigate the library system effortlessly. Users can search for available
books based on various criteria, fostering a convenient and enjoyable
experience.

2. Real-time Library Information: Real-time access to information is
provided, allowing users to check the availability of books, view library
wishlist items, and explore book reviews.

3. Secure and Seamless Library Transactions: The system offers a secure and
seamless process for library transactions, including book issuing and returns.
Users have the option to interact with the library independently through the
user portal or seek assistance from administrators (who use the admin portal).

4. Centralized Repository for Library Data: The library system establishes a
centralized repository for storing and managing critical information about
members, staff, available books, issued books, library wishlist, and book
reviews. This ensures a cohesive and organized approach to library
management.

5. Admin Functions: Administrators (librarians) have comprehensive control
over the entire library database. They can manage members, staff, available
books, issued books, library wishlist, and book reviews tables by performing
actions such as viewing, inserting, deleting, updating records. Administrators
can view details of every user in the system.

6. User Functions: Users can perform specific functions related to their own
information and library activities. This includes viewing and editing their
personal details in each table. Users cannot modify details of other users,
ensuring data privacy and security.

7. Overlap of Functions: The library system accommodates both online and
offline usage. Users can independently manage their library activities through
the user portal or collaborate with administrators for certain tasks. For
instance, a user can issue a book either online or by seeking assistance from
the admin, both resulting in modifications to the same table and account.
